<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>
  Shape-conveying line drawings generated from 3D models normally create closed regions in image space. These lines and regions can be stylized to mimic various artistic styles, but for complex objects, the extracted topology is unnecessarily dense, leading to unappealing and unnatural results under stylization. Prior works typically simplify line drawings without considering the regions between them, and lines and regions are stylized separately, then composited together, resulting in unintended inconsistencies. We present a method for joint simplification of lines and regions simultaneously that penalizes large changes to region structure, while keeping regions closed. This feature enables region stylization that remains consistent with the outline curves and underlying 3D geometry.
