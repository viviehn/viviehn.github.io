  <h1>Welcome to my portfolio.</h1>
  <p>
  Thank you for taking the time to view my portfolio. The works presented here represent many of the largest projects I've worked on. Projects done for CS 184, Foundations of Computer Graphics, include in depth, technical writeups on the contents of the project. For a quick look of what I've done, you can check out <a href="">my Demo Reel here [last created February 2018]</a>.</p>

      UCBUGG is a student-led course on 3D Modeling and Animation. In this class, I was the project manager for this animated short film, "The Duel". In addition to delegating and scheduling work amongst the team, I also worked directly on the short in various areas of the graphics pipeline. <br><br>
      I modeled and shaded the props, touched up the character models and applied their UV textures, animated the carrot action shots and all the blend shapes for closeups, animated the final scene of falling vegetables, and edited and composited the short in post-production. <br><br>
      This short uses music from the anime series <em>Naruto</em>, specifically the track 'Rising Fighting Spirit', composed by Toshio Masuda and Yasuharu Takanashi. We have yet to replace this track.

        For my Computer Graphics course's final project, my partner and I created a 2D interactive particle sandbox, modeled after popular online falling sand/powder games. Our simulation includes a number of different types of particles (called 'elements') that have unique properties and interact with each other in a variety of ways. The goal of our project was not to create a highly (visually or physically) accurate simulation, but rather to create something with a lot of variety, fast (realtime interactive), interesting to watch, and most importantly, fun to play with.

        In my personal favorite project from this course, I implemented a functional pathtracer, capable of rendering objects with hundreds of thousands of polygons by using a classic bounding volume hierarchy to accelerate ray-object intersections. It feaatures glass, mirror, and microfacet materials, and can also handle camera-like depth of field and focus effects, as well as global illumination from environment maps.

        This project covers the basics of creating and rendering meshes. It starts with basic subdivision routines to create Bezier curves and surfaces, then uses the halfedge mesh representation to implement Loop subdivision. It also supports simple Phong shading.

        Here, I worked to implement a mass and spring model to represent a cloth. I used Verlet integration to calculate the simulation, and the cloth can handle collisions with objects, as well as self-collisions.

        In the first project from CS184, we create a simple rasterizer. We are introduced to sampling as it relates to computer graphics, via anti-aliasing, utilizing barycentric coordinates, and various methods of sampling from a texture. We also implement standard affine transforms.
