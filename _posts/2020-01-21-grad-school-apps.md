I'm no admissions counselor, but I did apply twice!

## My Story

I first applied to a mix of Master's and PhD programs in Computer Science in the senior year of undergrad (approximately 10 different programs). I was accepted to the Masters program at UCSD, and the 5th-year MS program here at Berkeley. Ultimately, I chose to stay at Berkeley for a number of reasons, but primarily personal convenience and the opportunity to continue cultivating the research relationships I had already made.

When I applied the first time, I still felt relatively uncertain about whether or not I wanted to do a PhD or just a Master's degree. Even though I didn't really expect to get into any PhD programs, I remember being pretty disappointed about my results.

Hindsight is 20-20, but I'm pretty glad now that I had the opportunity to go through the 5th-year program at Berkeley. 

1. It really gave me time to think more about my research goals and interests, as well as being a relatively safe opportunity to pursue my own research project without too much pressure.
2. Gave me the second chance to build a PhD application that I was actually pretty proud of, and proud to stand behind.
3. I knew if I were to go on to a PhD program, it would be best to do it elsewhere (i.e. not at Berkeley). However, I've been incredibly lucky to have incredible faculty advisors and grad student mentors, and I'm very grateful for the opportunity to soak up more of their advice and enjoy more of their friendship.

This year, I applied to 16 (!!!) PhD programs (and 4 fellowships). It pretty much dominated the first few months of the fall semester. 

## The Application

Each application generally consists of the same components:

* Your statement of purpose
* Recommendation leters (usually 3)
* Your resume/CV
* Your transcript
* Your test scores (GRE, TOEFL, etc.)
* Your basic biographical information

People (myself included) often wonder which parts are the most important. An informal survey (asking faculty, students who've been on the admissions committee, the internet) somehow seems to suggest that everything matters the most, and also everything matters the least.

(The exception being test scores, which universally seem to be disregarded, unless alarmingly low.)

My only takeaway from this is the reminder that applications are generally read by real people, who value different things. In general, PhD applications seem to be an incredibly noisy process; it can be influenced by the school, year you're applying, area of research, and so on. 

### Statement of Purpose

This is probably the biggest difference for me between the first and second round of applications I went through. 

The first time, I lacked a lot of confidence in both myself and my goals. I think it really came out in my statement of purpose, which ended up being a pretty emotional statement about the challenges I felt I overcame, and how I felt that prepared me for grad school.

I don't think I regret writing it, but I have to acknowledge that I had written that statement for my own self, and my own validation. I think you should be honest in your statement of purpose, but also remember that it should be a highly optimized statement intended to convince a school (or potential advisor) to invest an inordinate amount of both time and money in you.

The second time, I felt a lot more clarity in what I was passionate about from an academic standpoint, what I wanted to do research in, and how I saw myself contributing to that area. This is pretty in line with Philip Guo's advice to write a "research-oriented" application. I also felt more confident that I had at least _something_ to offer and that my ideas had potential.


### Picking schools to apply to

... was a nightmare. I waffled on my list countless times
