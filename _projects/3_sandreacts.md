short: For my Computer Graphics course's final project, my partner and I created a 2D interactive particle sandbox, modeled after popular online falling sand/powder games. Our simulation includes a number of different types of particles (called 'elements') that have unique properties and interact with each other in a variety of ways. The goal of our project was not to create a highly (visually or physically) accurate simulation, but rather to create something with a lot of variety, fast (realtime interactive), interesting to watch, and most importantly, fun to play with.
