short: UCBUGG is a student-led course on 3D Modeling and Animation. In this class, I was the project manager for this animated short film, "The Duel". In addition to delegating and scheduling work amongst the team, I also worked directly on the short in various areas of the graphics pipeline. I modeled and shaded the props, touched up the character models and applied their UV textures, animated the carrot action shots and all the blend shapes for closeups, animated the final scene of falling vegetables, and edited and composited the short in post-production.
