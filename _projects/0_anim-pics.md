short: Implementation from scratch of "Animating Pictures with Stochastic Motion Textures" by Chuang et. al. 2005, for CS194-26 (Computational Photography) final project. This project includes implementing Bayesian matting, inpainting, and motion specification. I apply this technique to generate results on both paintings and photographs.
