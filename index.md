<h2>hello.</h2>

<p>
My name is Vivien Nguyen. I am a fourth year at UC Berkeley studying Computer Science. My interests are computer graphics, animation, and video games, as well as platform engineering and making tools for developers. Within computer graphics, I'm most interested in rendering and related technologies. I have a growing curiosity for computer vision and computational photography; as you can probably tell, visual computing is my obsession.

In particular, my research interests lie at the intersection of visual computing and the digital humanities. I am interested in exploring ways that we can utilize computer graphics to better share, analyze, visualize, and interact with cultural artifacts, such as heritage sites, paintings, and texts. I believe that cultural artifacts and historical information should be both accessible and exciting, and I believe that computer graphics is a key component of developing empathy for our collective past, present, and future.
