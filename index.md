## hello.

My name is Vivien Nguyen. I am a third year at UC Berkeley studying Computer Science. My interests are computer graphics, animation, and video games, as well as platform engineering and making tools for developers. Within computer graphics, I'm most interested in rendering and related technologies.

I'm passionate about design - of systems, of visuals, of everyday interactions.

I am currently the director at [Pioneers in Engineering](https://pioneers.berkeley.edu), a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization dedicated to STEM outreach, where I also serve on the Board of Directors. We're celebrating our 10th Anniversary this year! Please check us out if you're interested in getting involved or supporting our organization.
