## hello.

My name is Vivien Nguyen. I am a fourth year at UC Berkeley studying Computer Science. My interests are computer graphics, animation, and video games, as well as platform engineering and making tools for developers. Within computer graphics, I'm most interested in rendering and related technologies. I have a growing curiosity for computer vision and computational photography; as you can probably tell, visual computing is my obsession.

I'm passionate about design - of systems, of visuals, of everyday interactions.

I consider myself an advocate for the importance of mental health, and am deeply interested in STEM education, outreach, and methodology.

In 2017-2018, I was the director at [Pioneers in Engineering](https://pioneers.berkeley.edu), a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization dedicated to STEM outreach, where I also served on the Board of Directors. We celebrated our 10th Anniversary that year! Please check us out if you're interested in getting involved or supporting our organization.
