I'm currently a Master's student at UC Berkeley studying Computer Science and advised by Professor Ren Ng. My research interests are in computer graphics, computational photography, and computer vision. I'm particularly interested in applications related to preserving, studying, and visualizing cultural heritage.

I believe that cultural artifacts and historical information should be both accessible and exciting, and that computer graphics is a key component of developing empathy for our collective past, present, and future. The digital humanities provide a unique opportunity to understand other societies in new ways and drive advances in computer science.
<br/><br/>

Aside from these interests, I'm passionate about STEM education and mental health advocacy! I have TA'd CS 184 (Computer Graphics) at UC Berkeley three times, and I was the Director of <a href="https://pioneers.berkeley.edu" target="_blank">Pioneers in Engineering</a> in 2017-2018.
