I received my BA in Computer Science in 2019 and am currently completing my MS in EECS at UC Berkeley under the advisement of [Professor Ren Ng](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Faculty/Homepages/yirenng.html). I'm also extremely fortunate to be mentored by [Cecilia Zhang](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cecilia77/) and [Shiry Ginosar](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~shiry/). 

My research interests are in computer graphics, computational photography, and computer vision. I'm particularly interested in applications related to preserving, studying, and visualizing cultural heritage.

I believe that cultural artifacts and historical information should be both accessible and exciting, and that computer graphics is a key component of developing empathy for our collective past, present, and future. The digital humanities provide a unique opportunity to understand culture in new ways _and_ drive advances in computer science.

Aside from these interests, I'm passionate about STEM education and mental health advocacy! I have TA'd CS 184 (Computer Graphics) at UC Berkeley three times, and I was the Director of <a href="https://pioneers.berkeley.edu" target="_blank">Pioneers in Engineering</a> in 2017-2018. I will be one of the summer instructors for CS 184's first summer offering in 2020!
